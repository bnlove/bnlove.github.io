Vitruvia is a app available at [bricklayer.org](https://bricklayer.org/apps/vitruvia_New/main.html#concepts/). Its purpose is to provide a gentle introduction to bricklayer concepts through a series of automatically-graded interactive exercises.  Vitruvia also has a Test mode which is discussed in another post.

### Vitruvia Exercises

To work on Vitruvia exercises, go to [https://bricklayer.org/apps/vitruvia_New/main.html#concepts/](https://bricklayer.org/apps/vitruvia_New/main.html#concepts/).  If you are already on the bricklayer web site, click on "learn" at the top right, then from the menu, select
<center> Apps -> Vitruvia -> Exercises </center>
as shown below:
{% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-exercises01.jpg"  alt="Starting Vitruvia from bricklayer.org menu" caption="Starting Vitruvia from bricklayer.org menu" %}

This takes you to the **Concept 1 Demo 1** page. Before we look at that exercise, note the tabs at the top of the page showing **Concepts 1-10**, **Concepts 11-20**, and **Concepts 21-24**.  As you move along through the concepts during the semester, you can pull down the menu for the concept you're on and start there. For example, if you've completed Concepts 1-5, then you can go directly to Concept 6 by selecting
<center> Concepts 1-10 -> Concept 6 </center>
You can even choose a specific exercise if you'd like.

#### Choosing a brick color

Let's go back to **Concept 1 Demo 1** and discuss in general how to complete a Vitruvia exercise. The solution to each Vitruvia exercise is a placement of bricks (or blocks---I'll use the terms interchangeably) on the grid. To place a brick of a particular color on the grid, first click on the color, then click on the cell in the grid on which you place the brick.

When you want to change colors, click the next color you want and then click on cells.

##### If you put a brick in the wrong place

At some point you'll click in the wrong cell or have the wrong color selected. There are two approaches to fixing this problem:
   - Clear all bricks from the grid: Click on the _Clear_ button above the color list. This is a good option if you just want to start over.
   {% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-exercises04.png"  alt="Clear button in Vitruvia"  %}
   - Use the _EMPTY_ brick to remove other bricks: If you have only a few bricks that you'd like to erase/remove, click on the _EMPTY_ button in the brick color palette, then click on the bricks you want to remove.  When you're ready to place bricks of another color, just click on that color and continue.

#### Locating grid cells

So now we know how to pick a brick color, let's consider how to know where to put a brick.
Cells in the grid are represented by two values, called coordinates.  These are also referred to as _ordered pairs_. As you may surmise, the _order_ in which the coordinates are listed is important. The first coordinate refers to the horizontal dimension, i.e., how far _over_ while the second coordinate refers the the vertical dimension, i.e., how far _up_.  For example, cell (2,3) is two blocks over and three blocks up from (0,0), as shown in the grid below.


{% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-exercises06.jpg"  alt="Horizontal and vertical coordinates"  %}

Here are a couple more examples.

#### More help locating grid Cells

If you find yourself confused about cell locations, you can use the _Display Coordinates_ option. This is above the color palette and below the grid. Click the _NO_ button to see the coordinates as shown below.
{% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-exercises09.jpg"  alt="See grid coordinates in Vitruvia"  %}

The _NO_ button changes (toggles) to _YES_ and the coordinates of each cell are displayed.

{% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-exercises10.png"  alt="See grid coordinates in Vitruvia"  %}

To hide the coordinates, click the _YES_ button. In general you should make the coordinates visible only if you feel you need to. Practice so that you eventually do not need them.

#### Complete *Concept 1 Demo 1* exercise

Now you know how to choose the color that you want and how to locate cell locations.  You're ready to complete the first exercise. The directions are as follows:

{% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-exercises11.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 1 Demo 1"  %}

The steps to do this are:

    1. Click on the GREEN brick.
    2. Locate cell (0,0) - over 0 and up 0; click on it.
    3. Locate cell (5,1) - over 5 and up 1; click on it.
    4. Locate cell (1,2) - over 1 and up 2; click on it.
    5. Locate cell (4,3) - over 4 and up 3; click on it.
    6. Locate cell (2,4) - over 2 and up 4; click on it.
    7. Locate cell (3,5) - over 3 and up 5; click on it.   

The grid should look as follows. Click the _Submit_ button at the bottom to check your answer.

{% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-exercises12.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 1 Demo 1 solution"  %}

Assuming your solution is correct, fireworks will appear in place of the grid.

{% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-exercises13.png"  alt="Vitruvia fireworks"  %}

If your solution is incorrect, you will see a _Try Again_ message. At this point you have two options.  One is to click on the _Clear_ button to redo the exercise.  The other is to click on the _Show Solution_ button to see the solution.  Try to avoid showing the solution unless you've given the exercise your best shot and don't understand how to do it.  If you show the solution, spend time studying it to understand why it is correct.

When you're ready to go to the next exercise, click on the _Next_ button.
