In Vitruvia Concept 4, you are asked to place a sequence of bricks in various locations.  For example, consider these instructions:

1. Put a 1x1 GREEN brick at location (4,3).
2. Put a 2x1 BLUE brick at location (1,0).
3. Put a 4x2 YELLOW brick at location (0,3).
4. Put a 1x2 RED brick at (3,1).

For each of these brick placements, you follow the same squence of steps:
1. Click on the color you want.
2. Click on the location given (*over* and *up*).
3. Click on other cells to create the right-sized brick, remembering that the block you place in step 2 is the lower left corner of the whole brick.

Let's go through the sequence.

#### Put a 1x1 GREEN brick at location (4,3).
   1. Click on GREEN.
   2. Click on (4,3) --- (over 4 and up 3)
      {% include image.html img="vitruvia/concept4-01.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 4-01" %}
  {:start="3"}
   3. Since we're only placing a 1x1 brick, we're done with this one.


#### Put a 2x1 BLUE brick at location (1,0).
  1. Click on BLUE.
  2. Click on (1,0)
     {% include image.html img="vitruvia/concept4-02.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 4-02" %}
 {:start="3"}
  3. We need to place a 2x1 brick, so we have more work to do.  First, let's remember what a 2x1 brick looks like.  Remember  (*over* and *up*), so 2 *over/wide* and 1 *up/tall*.
  {% include image.html img="vitruvia/concept4-03.jpg"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 4-03" %}
  So we click in cell (2,0) to create the 2x1 blue brick with lower left corner at (1,0).
  {% include image.html img="vitruvia/concept4-04.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 4-04" %}


#### Put a 4x2 YELLOW brick at location (0,3).
   1. Click on YELLOW.
   2. Click on (0,3).
      {% include image.html img="vitruvia/concept4-05.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 4-05" %}
   {:start="3"}
   3. This time we're placing a 4x2 brick, so we have more to do. A 4x2 brick is 4 *wide* and 2 *tall*, so we click on cells (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4) to create the 4x2 brick.
   {% include image.html img="vitruvia/concept4-06.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 4-06" %}


#### Put a 1x2 RED brick at (3,1).
  1. Click on RED.
  2. Click on (3,1).
     {% include image.html img="vitruvia/concept4-07.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 4-07" %}
  {:start="3"}
  3. This time we're placing a 1x2 brick which is 1 *wide* and 2 *tall*, so we click on cell (3,2) to create the 1x2 brick.
  {% include image.html img="vitruvia/concept4-08.png"  alt="Vitruvia Concept 4-08" %}

Thinking ahead....what happens if we place a brick in a position that is already covered by another brick???
