1. FromÂ [https://bricklayer.org](https://bricklayer.org) select Apps -> Vitruvia -> Tests
   {% include image.html img="vitruvia/vitruvia-test01.png"  alt="Starting Vitruvia tests from bricklayer.org menu" %}

{:start="2"}
2. Select the concept(s) you want to be tested on.  Note that you can select any number of concepts. For the first assignment, you should just choose Concept 1.

3. Select the number of questions you want the test to contain. In the image below, I have chosen 10.

{:start="4"}
4. Answer the questions, clicking "Check" after each answer.

5. If you are doing a test for an Assignment, take a screenshot of the test summary so that you can submit it.
