In this class, you will be using a computer a lot!  This page covers some basic skills you need.

### What kind of computer do I need?
For the first couple of weeks of the course, all work will be done in a web browser. During this period you could use a computer, tablet, ipad, or Chromebook. In a pinch, you could even use a phone, but the screen is really too small to be able to work effectively.

Afterward, you need an actual computer.  You can use either a Mac or PC. Other devices will no longer be sufficient.

### Software needed

#### Web browser
Throughout the course we will heavily use the website [bricklayer.org](https://bricklayer.org). For best results, use the Chrome browser. It should already be installed on the machines on campus. If you need to install it on your computer, go to [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

#### The Bricklayer app
If you're using your own computer, you'll need to install the Bricklayer app.  Following are links to go to to download it. If you need help with installation, email Dr. Love.

- Mac:  [Bricklayer IDE](https://bricklayer.org/mac-os-download/)
- Windows: [Bricklayer IDE](https://bricklayer.org/windows-download/) (either .exe or .zip)
