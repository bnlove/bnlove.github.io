In this class, you will be using a computer a lot!  This page covers some basic skills you need.

### What kind of computer do I need?
For the first four weeks of the course, all work will be done in a web browser. During this period you could use a computer, tablet, ipad, or Chromebook. In a pinch, you could even use a phone, but the screen is really too small to be able to work effectively.

After week four, you need an actual computer.  You can use either a Mac or PC. Other devices will no longer be sufficient.

### Software needed

#### Web browser
Throughout the course we will heavily use the website [bricklayer.org](https://bricklayer.org). For best results, use the Chrome browser. It should already be installed on the machines on campus. If you need to install it on your computer, go to [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

#### The Bricklayer app
This is not needed during the first four weeks of class. More on this later.
